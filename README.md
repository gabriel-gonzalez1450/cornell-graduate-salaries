# Description
This is the first of two projects for the class CS 3300: Data-Driven Web Applications. The task was to create a static data visualization. My group consisted of me and two other people. The work for this project was strongly divided. As such, the piece I have shown here is only my work. There were two other plots/charts in the original page.

This plot shows where Cornell CS students go after graduation, how much they earn, and what the job growth in that city is.
